This tool "Password Complexity Checker" assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of upper case and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. It provides feedback to users on the password strength.
It imports the Regular Expression library for pattern matching.
The program was run on Google Colab for different passwords and feedbacks were provided.
